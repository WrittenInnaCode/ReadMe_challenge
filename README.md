# README Generator

## Description:
This is a Node.js application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.
  
## Features
 When the user is prompted for information about their application repository, such as the project title, a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the corresponding sections of the README.md file. When the user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README. Also, when the user enters their GitHub username, the link is created to their GitHub profile.
